## üï¥ Behind the Scenes
This is a starter site is built with [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/), [Contentful](https://www.contentful.com/) and [Kometa UI Kit's
](https://kitwind.io/products/kometa) free [Tailwind](https://tailwindcss.com/) components.

To [create a site](https://app.stackbit.com/create?theme=https://github.com/stackbit-themes/tailwind-nextjs-contentful&utm_source=theme-readme&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=stackbit_themes) from this starter using Stackbit you'll need to have a GitHub and a Contentful account and connect them with Stackbit. 

Stackbit will run the following steps for you:

1. Create a new GitHub repository with the contents of this repository.
2. Create a new [Contentful](https://www.contentful.com) project and provision it with the initial contents stored in [export.json](contentful-export/export.json) file.
3. Create a new [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com) site connected to the GitHub repo
4. Deploy the Netlify site.
5. Create a Stackbit project that will allow you to visually edit your website.

Additionally, Stackbit will connect all three services together by:

1. Creating a "commit" webhook in GitHub repository that will trigger Netlify deployment as soon as new commit is pushed to GitHub.
2. Creating a "publish" webhook in Contentful that will trigger Netlify deployment as soon as content is published in Contentful.
